- **Size Morphing**: Scale animates from 1.0f (default) to 1.15f (selected) 
- **Spring Physics**: Natural, bouncy animations using Material 3 spring specifications
  - Corner radius: `dampingRatio = 0.6f, stiffness = 800f`
  - Scale animation: `dampingRatio = 0.7f, stiffness = 900f`
- **Selection State**: `FocusedCellPanel` now receives `selectedMedia` parameter for accurate state tracking

**Technical Changes**:
1. **FocusedCellPanel.kt**:
   - Added `selectedMedia: Media?` parameter
   - Added `isSelected` logic based on media comparison
   - Enhanced `PhotoPreviewItem` with animation imports and spring animations
   - Implemented `animateDpAsState` for corner radius morphing
   - Implemented `animateFloatAsState` for scale morphing
   - Added `scale()` and animated `RoundedCornerShape()` modifiers

2. **App.kt**:
   - Updated `FocusedCellPanel` call to pass `selectedMedia` parameter

**User Experience**:
- Selected photos now visually "pop out" with larger size and softer corners
- Smooth, physics-based transitions provide tactile feedback
- Clear visual indication of current selection state
- Maintains accessibility and usability while adding expressive delight

**Animation Specifications**:
- Uses Material 3 `spring()` animation with custom damping and stiffness
- Corner radius morphs smoothly between rectangular (4.dp) and rounded (16.dp) states
- Scale provides subtle size emphasis without disrupting layout
- Animations feel natural and responsive to user interaction
